## SISO-REF-010: Reference for Enumerations for Simulation Interoperability

From SISO SISO-REF-010:

1 Introduction.
The Standards Activity Committee Special Working Group Reference for Enumerations for Simulation
(SAC SWG ENUM) publishes, maintains, supports, and updates this SISO Reference Product. The SISO
Reference Product, SISO-REF-010.1, provides information for submitting enumerations and participating
in the enumerations process. See 1.5 for more information.

1.1 Purpose.
This document specifies the numerical values and associated definitions for those fields that are identified
as enumerations in Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) standards and in SISOsponsored
standards published by IEEE.

1.2 Scope.
This document applies to enumerations that might occur in SISO standards or SISO-sponsored IEEE
standards. Because entity-type enumerations have been widely adopted, their use has expanded to
other standards and specifications employing these types of enumerations beyond the original usage.
Thus, protocol-specific fields are included in annexes to this document.

1.3 Objective.
The objective for this document is to define a consistent schema and repository for enumerations for
distributed simulation.

1.4 Intended Audience.
This document applies to anyone interested in distributed simulation or interoperability, including but not
limited to users of Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), High-Level Architecture (HLA), and Test and
Training Enabling Architecture (TENA).
